this is my first official attempt at using the Bukkit library to alter properties of a minecraft sever. Makes a few minor changes and adds a few listeners 
upon both shield usage and damage taken to a player character with my exact minecraft username

## installation
export as a .jar file, and import into the FTP files of your minecraft server. Ensure the server is running an updated version of Bukkit, and restart your server.

## usage
this plugin requires no external commands to operate, simply just install into the server, no further instruction needed

## contributing
pull request would be more than appreciated, feel free to use as you please. In the case of a major change/bug, please 
open an issue and discuss what you would like changed
